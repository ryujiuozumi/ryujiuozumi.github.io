**For current students at Tokyo Tech

If you are a current Tokyo Tech student and are interested in working with me, send me an email. I will be happy to talk about projects. 

**For prospective students at Tokyo Tech

If you want to do a PhD at Tokyo Tech Biostat, send me an email with your CV attached. However, please keep in mind I am not on the admission committee and I have no say over who gets admitted to the department, but once you are admitted I would love to talk more.
